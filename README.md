Hello! This is aiz and my portfolio + projects. The website itself is a project I worked on during my Art 74 Class @sjsu 
All of the work and shared content here is primarily mine, and there is proper crediting to outside sources. I do not mind if you take the code I have here as long as I am properly credited. 
I also do not authorize you to use, reproduce, or distribute my art. 
I do not authorize any of my art to be scrapped or used for/ in AI
